Project Dispatch: The FPS Creator

The best way I could describe this project is RPG Maker for FPS games. From what I've seen this has not been done on this scale before.

I believe that this has potential to make it big in both the indie and mainstream gaming world, if we do things just the right way.
As this is going to be a team project, definitely feel free to chip in with your input.

The design and implementation for this is going to be a massive undertaking, so you're either in or you're out.
We have no time for halfways/maybes. My hope is to be finished with a bare-bones project in a year, and go from there.

We will be developing in the Unity 5 engine, so I suggest that you go familiarize yourself with that if you have not done so already.
