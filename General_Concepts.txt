In the base game, I envision three main areas that players will have free rein to create and edit in, along with two lesser areas.
The three main areas are: Maps, Weapons, and Gamemodes.
The two lesser areas are: Player-models and Items.

For maps, there will be full premades, templates, and a start-from-scratch custom option.
For weapons, there will be full premades, base weapons, and custom.
For gamemodes, there will be premades and custom.
For player-models, there will be full premades and custom.
For items, there will be full premades and custom.
For all areas, premades can also be used as templates.

In-depth: MAPS

Maps will have five sub-areas of design that the player can use. These will be floor, platform, wall, pillar, and prop.
For all of these, there will be premades and custom. Premade or custom textures can be placed on all surfaces in maps.


In-depth: WEAPONS

In an attempt to keep things rather simplistic, weapons will have types. These types will be the following:
- Handgun
- Revolver
- Rifle
- Assault Rifle
- Sub-Machine Gun
- Light Machine Gun
- Grenade Launcher
- Rocket-Propelled Grenade Launcher
- Melee

Each will have components, animations, and premades inherent to the type.
Each weapon will have base stats, which are determined by components and can be muliplied or changed by the gamemode.

In-depth: GAMEMODES

Gamemodes and maps go hand-in-hand. In order to play a gamemode on a map, you must first apply a gamemode to the map.
